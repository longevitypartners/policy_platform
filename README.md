## Database Setup with Supabase

To set up the database for this application:

1. Create a new Supabase project at [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)

2. Enable Auth in your Supabase project:
   - Go to Authentication > Providers in your Supabase dashboard
   - Enable Email provider
   - For development, you may want to disable "Confirm Email" to make testing easier
   - Set any password strength requirements you prefer

3. Create the following tables in your Supabase database:

### Policies Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE policies (
  policy_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  category TEXT,
  country TEXT,
  risk_rating INTEGER,
  entry_into_force TEXT,
  last_amended TEXT,
  implications TEXT,
  url_implications TEXT,
  url_regulation TEXT,
  policy_type TEXT,
  provision_ids INTEGER[],
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Provisions Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE provisions (
  provision_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  policy_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  requirement TEXT,
  description TEXT,
  minimum_requirement TEXT,
  best_practice TEXT,
  subject_to_obligation TEXT,
  asset_class TEXT,
  building_status TEXT,
  country TEXT,
  year_of_enforcement TEXT,
  year_in_force TEXT,
  policy TEXT,
  topic TEXT,
  url_minimum_standards TEXT,
  url_best_practice TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Users Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  companyname VARCHAR,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now())
);
```

### User Notification Settings Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_notification_settings (
  user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email_notifications BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  policy_digest TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'weekly',
  risk_alerts BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now())
);
```

4. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in your project root with these variables:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```
   
   To get these values:
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Click on the "Settings" icon (gear) in the sidebar
   - Go to "API" in the settings menu
   - Your project URL is listed under "Project URL"
   - Your anon key is listed under "Project API keys" > "anon public"
   - Copy these values into your `.env` file

5. Set up Row Level Security (RLS):
   - Go to your Supabase SQL editor
   - Enable RLS on all tables by running:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE policies ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ALTER TABLE provisions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ALTER TABLE user_notification_settings ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ```
   - Add policies to allow authenticated users to read data:
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated read access" ON policies
   FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (true);

   CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated read access" ON provisions
   FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (true);

   CREATE POLICY "Allow users to manage their own data" ON users
   FOR ALL TO authenticated USING (auth.uid() = id);

   CREATE POLICY "Allow users to manage their own settings" ON user_notification_settings
   FOR ALL TO authenticated USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
   ```

6. (Optional) Import sample data:
   You can find sample data for the tables in the `sample_data` directory (if provided).

7. Deployment Environment Variables:
   When deploying (e.g., to Vercel), make sure to add these environment variables in your deployment platform:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

## I want to use a custom domain - is that possible?

Yes, you can set up your custom domain on the deployment platform that you choose. 
E.g. Vercel, AWS Amplify, Cloudflare, Netlify etc.

## Deployment

### Recommended: Vercel Deployment

1. **Prepare for deployment**
   - Ensure your code is pushed to a GitHub repository
   - Have your Supabase project ready

2. **Deploy to Vercel**
   1. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and sign in
   2. Click "New Project"
   3. Import your GitHub repository
   4. Configure project:
      - Framework Preset: Vite
      - Root Directory: ./
      - Build Command: npm run build
      - Output Directory: dist
   5. Add environment variables:
      - VITE_SUPABASE_URL
      - VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   6. Click "Deploy"

3. **Configure custom domain (optional)**
   1. Go to your project settings in Vercel
   2. Navigate to "Domains"
   3. Add your custom domain and follow the DNS configuration instructions

## Database Structure and Relationships

### Authentication

This application uses Supabase's built-in authentication system, which:
- Automatically manages user accounts in the `auth.users` table
- Handles session management and security
- Provides ready-to-use authentication APIs
- Does not require any custom user tables

> Note: The auth tables are managed by Supabase in a separate `auth` schema and should not be modified directly.

### Active Application Tables

### Planned Future Implementation

#### Authentication Abstraction
The application currently uses Supabase's built-in authentication system (`auth.users`). However, the following table structure is planned for teams who wish to abstract the authentication service away from Supabase in the future:

**users**
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  companyname VARCHAR,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now())
);
```
- Would enable custom user management
- Could serve as an abstraction layer between the application and authentication provider
- Allows for easier migration away from Supabase Auth if needed
- Enables additional user-specific data storage

#### Notification System
The following table is planned for implementing user notification features:

**user_notification_settings**
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_notification_settings (
  user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email_notifications BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  policy_digest TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'weekly',
  risk_alerts BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now())
);
```
- Will store user notification preferences
- Will enable features like:
  - Email notifications
  - Policy digest subscriptions
  - Risk alerts
- Would relate to the `users` table once implemented

> Note: These tables are not currently in use. The application uses Supabase's built-in authentication system (`auth.users`) for user management. The above schemas are provided for teams who wish to implement custom user management or notification features in the future.
